# Lucky Crystal

A minimal Docker image that has Lucky and Crystal in it.

## Roadmap

* Add build pipeline so that when version numbers are bumped / committed here a new Docker image goes up.
* Add a default non-root user like Node does?
* Add a default entrypoint to `lucky init` to use as an executable?
* Nightly builds / regular builds instead of push only?
* Better DockerHub page.
